## 🎯 Risk Assessment

### LOW RISK ✅
- **Database Layer:** Complete and tested
- **Encryption:** Hardware keychain integration validated
- **Insight Engines:** All three operational with statistical rigor
- **Decision Engine:** MAUT implementation complete

### MEDIUM RISK ⚠️
- **UI Development:** Large surface area, requires rapid iteration
- **Performance:** Need to validate <2s insight budget on real devices
- **Beta Recruitment:** Need 50-100 engaged testers

### HIGH RISK 🚨
- **4-Week Retention:** THE go/no-go metric - unknown until beta launch
- **Insight Quality:** Will users find insights valuable enough to keep logging?
- **Onboarding Friction:** Can we reduce Day 0 churn with LLM Quick Start?

---

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Why This Matters
We've implemented **the three highest-risk psychological innovations** that differentiate this product:

1. **Privacy-First Architecture** → B2B differentiator, regulatory compliance
2. **Insight-Driven Loop** → Solves the broken feedback loop (THE MOAT)
3. **LLM Onboarding** → Reduces Day 0 churn (cold start problem)

**Critical Milestone:** If backend is solid, UI development can proceed rapidly. We've de-risked the hardest parts.

### Competitive Advantage
No existing decision app has:
- ✅ On-device encryption with hardware keychain
- ✅ Statistical insight engines that reward outcome logging
- ✅ LLM-powered zero-effort onboarding
- ✅ Classical + quantum-inspired decision modeling (Phase 2)
